# My-Matplotlib-Program-
Some practice of using Matplotlib
I wrote a booklet this winter, about some basic concepts and methods in Matplotlib. This booklet is actually written for myself to read, in case I forgot those fancy skills of drawing pictures using Matplotlib. In this repository, I will upload some of my programs appearing in my booklet. I made it public. Hopefully some guys may find those programs interesting and would like to run them.
